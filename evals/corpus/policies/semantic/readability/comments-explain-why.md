# Comments explain why

We use comments for intent, constraints, and reasons — not to narrate code. Report comments that only restate what the next line obviously does (`// increment i`, `# loop over users`, `// return the result`), and comments that contradict the code they describe. Doc comments describing a public API, license headers, and tool directives are not violations.
