#### Error Wrapping

There are three main options for propagating errors if a call fails:

- return the original error as-is
- add context with `fmt.Errorf` and the `%w` verb
- add context with `fmt.Errorf` and the `%v` verb

Return the original error as-is if there is no additional context to add.
This maintains the original error type and message.
This is well suited for cases when the underlying error message
has sufficient information to track down where it came from.

Otherwise, add context to the error message where possible
so that instead of a vague error such as "connection refused",
you get more useful errors such as "call service foo: connection refused".
