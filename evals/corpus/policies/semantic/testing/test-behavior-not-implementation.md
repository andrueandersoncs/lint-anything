# Test behavior, not implementation

Tests should check what the code under test does through its public interface. Report tests that assert on private or internal fields, on the exact sequence of internal helper calls, on how many times a non-boundary internal function was called, or that mock parts of the unit under test itself. Mocking or stubbing true external boundaries (network, database, clock, filesystem) and asserting on calls to them is fine.
